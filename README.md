# GraphComparison
University project that involves a flask server with database, login/session handling, and comparing shortest path graph algorithms.

# What Could Be Added
- better error handling in graph creation.

# What I Learned
- unit testing and exception handling from the get go, a lot easier than handling in retrospect.
